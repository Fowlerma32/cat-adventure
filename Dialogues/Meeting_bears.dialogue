Polar Bear leader: We did not take any stone from them and they are blaming us. We were walking by and the penguins were happy and giggling so we stopped and chatted for a minute. 

Mayor: So you did not steal their shiny rock?

Polar Bear Leader: No, the rock is called pink quartz and we even told them that. We left after that, they probably dropped it somewhere and can’t find it. 

Mayor: …… 

Mayor: I will look, thank you for your time!
- Find the Rose quartz
