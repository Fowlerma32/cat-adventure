This is a game where you play as a cat mayor of the town, helping the local villagers with tasks. As mayor your goal is to make the town a welcoming and safe place. The town is a place of diversity with multiple different animal species and your job is to help them adjust to the town! 
The game will have a map encompassing the heart of the town, some maps that include the outskirts of town including a mountain map and a forest map. These maps will be unlocked through various quests.

We wish to implement multiple quests given by the villagers, a rewards system for improving the town, and the villagers' homes. The quests will be educational minigames, such as differentiating poisonous and edible plants/herbs, learning measurements for cooking basic meals, and some animal care facts. Some villager quests will be delivered via parrot, and others will be gained from shopkeeper or the innkeeper.

This project will use use Godot as the game engine, allowing us to create the actual game features. Libresprite and Piskell will be used to create the pixel art for the game graphics. Additionally, Soundtrap will be used to create the music and sound effects for the game.
